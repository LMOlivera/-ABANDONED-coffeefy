Who makes coffee today?
=================
We often argue at work about who's turn is to make coffee. With this app, that won't happen anymore!

### What you can do
You create an account in which you will store your coworkers' name, and everyday that person has to confirm he/she made coffee
so the next day another one is in charge of making it.
